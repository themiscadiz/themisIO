                <b>Reading Blocks is an educational tool for children that improves
                    engagement in the process of learning.</b>
                <br>
                I prototyped a block puzzle game that builds sentences. The user interacts with
                screen-based tasks through physical objects. The physical objects are blocks that should be placed in an
                order that the task implies. When the child positions the blocks, this triggers an animation on the
                screen or the next steps to complete.

                <p class="intro_p">Having a functional prototype allowed me to test, with more reliability, how a user
                    realistically interacts with the interface and object.
                    After user testing, I laser cut a visible path (rectangle and arrows) demonstrating how to actually
                    place the blocks in the box. This simple change immediately generated more visibility as to how the
                    blocks should interact with the box.</p>

                    <p class="intro_p">For future work, I would like to continue exploring how to improve the interaction to be more intuitive, make
                        the app more tolerant of errors and test a different version of interaction with multiple RFID readers. My next
                        step is to test this in a learning context with a younger user to see how they will interact. However, I enjoyed
                        building this project because it allowed me to combine many skills that I learned this semester. The process of
                        learning through this project was bigger than expected.</p>
