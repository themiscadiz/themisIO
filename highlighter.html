                    text. Our solution was to create a set of guidelines to make <b>accessible labeling</b>
                    from scratch and a device to highlight relevant information.
                    <!-- 
                    We continued researching how to implement the QR code, as well as exploring the usage of RFID and NFC. 
                    We also explored more analog technology, such as using invisible ink to highlight the key ideas in a museum 
                    exhibit or display. We explored the possible pain-points and advantages of each idea.

                    
                    For the highlight viewer we worked in a design process to develope the prototype.
                    
                    Our design is a physical device that when hovered over text highlights specific content while 
                    blocking out the rest of the text. -->
