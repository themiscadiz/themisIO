                    In the research process, I discovered that the general attitude in Puerto Rico is that public
                    transportation is unreliable. Loss of motivation is most often noted as occurring when clients wait
                    for the bus to arrive or depart. Lack of itineraries and unpredictability were found to be the main
                    reasons why potential users prefer to use other modes of transportation. Secondary research also
                    demonstrates how the lack of options for reliable public transportation contributes to social
                    inequality. </p>

                    currently uses the share-taxi system on an infrequent basis. The Journey Map revealed the high and
                    low points of the travel experience, as well as the reasons occasional users are generally
                    dissatisfied with the Pisicorre experience.

                    </br><b>Seat Availability Monitoring</b> allows users to estimate departure times without setting
                    specific schedules. Increased usage can give the system a level of predictability in terms of
                    waiting time.

                    </br><b>Favorite Routes</b> allow users to access their most commonly used routes, speeding up the
                    process.

                    </br><b>Service Alerts</b> inform the users of changes in routes, delays and traffic updates.

                <p class="intro_p">This project envisions new ways to increase the possibilities for social and physical
                    mobility for the population of Puerto Rico. Having used public transportation for many years, I
                    understand the anxiety of depending on a public transportation system that proved to be unreliable.
                    This project cannot be envisioned without a sense of urgency to create a realistic tool which will
                    have social impact. Although there is still a lot of work to do in this Service Design Project, it
                    is easy to imagine the effect that its implementation can have on the Puerto Rico transportation
                    system.
