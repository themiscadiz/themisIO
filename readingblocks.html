            <p class="project_intro_p">
                The shared-taxi system, known as “Pisicorre” (Step-and-Go), is the collective transportation system with
                the greatest number of routes on the island, serving both the urban and rural areas. However, due to
                urban development and the general dependency on the privately owned car, the Pisicorre is on the verge
                of disappearing. The reduction of service hours, elimination of routes and a decrease in the number of
                drivers also factor in to decrease customer use. Factoring in little to no economic support from the
                government, the survival of Pisicorre is exclusively dependent on client demand.

                screen or the next steps to complete.

                    The animation is a visualization of the sentence that the user has to build. In the app, there are
                    two buttons. The first button gives the user a hint as to what the sentence is about (as shown in
                    the left image, below). The second button gives a quick summary of how to play the game (right
                    image, below). To build more <b>visibility</b> into the system, I implement three circles on the
                    top; these
                    represents the number of tasks and the stage that the user is in.</p>

                    realistically interacts with the interface and object.
                    After user testing, I laser cut a visible path (rectangle and arrows) demonstrating how to actually
                    place the blocks in the box. This simple change immediately generated more visibility as to how the
                    blocks should interact with the box.</p>
