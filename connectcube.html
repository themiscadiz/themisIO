                <p class="intro_p">I conducted 2 user testing sessions: for the physical interaction and for the app
                    onboarding process. Based on these findings, I was able to iterate design and make improvements on
                    the interactions.</p>

                <p class="intro_p"><b>To simulate the interaction, I rapidly coded a custom remote user test.</b><br>
                    These tests allowed me to check my assumptions and quickly gain insight into problems in the
                    interaction and the intuitiveness.
