            <p class="project_intro_p">This project details my UX Research and design process
                for a smartphone application called Pisicorre. </br> The shared-taxi system known
                as “Pisicorre” (Step-and-Go) is the collective transportation system with the
                most routes on the island (both in urban and rural areas). However, due to the
                development of urbanized areas and the general dependency on the privately owned
                car, the Pisicorre is on the verge of disappearing. The existence of Pisicorre
                depends on client demand, with little or no economic support from the government.
                Less service hours, elimination of routes and the limited number of drivers also
                factor in to decreased usage.

                        motivation</b> happens when waiting for the bus to depart or arrive. <b>Lack of
                        itinerary and unpredictability are the main reasons why potential users would rather
                        not use the Pisicorre.</b>Furthermore, secondary research shows how the lack of options

                    Pisicorre system.
                    This platform supports passenger needs and increases demand for drivers. To increase trust
                    in the service, a social connection is established through driver profiles. The design
                    leverages users with smartphones and internet connection (a large number of the population
                    of Puerto Rico) to improve a pre-existing form of public transportation. Drivers increase
                    their customer base by providing more visibility to their service.

                    Having been a user of public transportation for many years, I understand the anxiety
                    of depending on a public transportation service that is unreliable. This project
                    cannot be envisioned without a sense of urgency to create a realistic tool which will
                    have social impact.
                    Although there is still a lot of work to do in this service design project, it’s easy
                    to imagine the effect that its implementation could have on Puerto Rico.
