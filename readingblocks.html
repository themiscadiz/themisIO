                I prototyped a block puzzle game to build sentences. The user would interact with 
                screen-based tasks through physical objects. These physical objects are blocks placed 
                in the order that the task implies. After the children position the blocks this will 
                trigger an animation on the screen or the next step to complete.

                    how a user would more interact more realistically with the interface and object.
                </br>After the user testing, I laser cut a visible path about how to place the blocks 
                    in the box. This simple change immediately generates more visibility about how to 
                    interact with the box.</p>
